# pushaas-aws-ecs-config

This is documented [here](https://github.com/pushaas/pushaas-docs#component-pushaas-aws-ecs-config).

Please note, this configuration is less than ideal, for several reasons:

- it should have used both a public and private subnets
- it should have stricter security groups
- others

Use only as a simple starting point.
